# List of programs to be used to compile
# a wide variety of programs
commands:
    # C compiler
    cc: icc
    # C++ compiler
    cxx: icpc

    fc: ifort
    # If a more-specific compiler is required:
    f77: ifort

# Variants can add flavour to test requiring them.
# For instance a test asking for the variant 'openmp'
# will have its cflags extended with the content of
# openmp.args here
variants:
    openmp:
        args: "-openmp"

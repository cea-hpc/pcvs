# Declaration of criterion
# Here is set any element to describe what an criterion iterator does
# A criterion is small component a test is relying on to be validated
# For instance, an MPI program has the following components:
# - number of nodes to be executed on
# - number of MPI ranks
# - number of cores allocated for each MPI rank
# - Type of network to enable inter process communication
# A single test is a combination of one single value picked up from
# these components.
criterions:
    # please use a short, without-space names
    n_mpi:
        # option known by the runtime to handle a value of this component
        option: "-np "
        # Is the sequence of values only number ?
        numeric: true
        # two cases:
        # - argument -> $PROGRAM $OPTION$VALUE ./a.out
        # - environment -> $OPTION=$VALUE $PROGRAM ./a.out
        type: "argument"
        # should the value put before or after the option name ?
        position: "after"
    n_omp:
        option: "OMP_NUM_THREADS="
        numeric: true
        type: "environment"
        position: "after"

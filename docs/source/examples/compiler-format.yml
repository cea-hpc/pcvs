# List of programs to be used to compile
# a wide variety of programs
# Variants can add flavour to test requiring them.
# For instance a test asking for the variant 'openmp'
# will have its cflags extended with the content of
# openmp.args here. Variants override parent fields, except
# list objects, where more specialized content is appended
# to the parent
# C compiler
cc:
    program: "/path/to/cc"
    args: ["-Wall", "-foption"]
    envs: ["MPI_CC=cc", "EXTRA_FLAGS=-foption"]
    variant:
        openmp:
            args: ["-fopenmp"]
        mpi:
            program: "/path/to/mpicc"
# available keys: cc, cxx, fc, f77, f90, f08, accl
# The drawback here is to duplicate variants for each compiler
# please use YAML anchors (&, *) when possible:
# cc:
#   variant: &variants_below
#     openmp: 
#       args: ['-fopenmp'] 
# cxx:
#   variant: *variants_below

# Manage the compiler through a package manager
# Before any test to be run, the PM is invoked to load
# everything required.
# Note, only a single can be specified but both can be used
# at the same time

    spack:

# List of programs to be used to compile
# a wide variety of programs
commands:
    # C compiler
    cc: "/path/to/cc"
    # C++ compiler
    cxx: "/pat/to/cxx"
    # Fortran compiler
    fc: "/path/to/fc"
    # If a more-specific compiler is required:
    f77: "/path/to/f77"
    f90: "/path/to/f90"

# Variants can add flavour to test requiring them.
# For instance a test asking for the variant 'openmp'
# will have its cflags extended with the content of
# openmp.args here
variants:
    openmp:
        args: "-fopenmp"
    tbb:
        args: "-ltbb -ltbbmalloc -ldl"
    cuda:
        args: ""
    strict:
        args: "-Werror -Wall -Wextra"

# Manage the compiler through a package manager
# Before any test to be run, the PM is invoked to load
# everything required.
# Note, only a single can be specified but both can be used
# at the same time
package_manager:
    spack:
        - "name@version+variants"
    module:
        - "group/flavor/version"
